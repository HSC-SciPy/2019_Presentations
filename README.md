## Introduction

Python is the rising franca lingua of scientific computing and has relatively easy to use syntax   Python can be applied to a diverse range of problems. The are over 165,000 packages in the Python Package Index. Python is also able to interface with the statistical package R and most software used in bioinformatics, molecular biology, and structural biology.  The objective of this group is to gather together Python users at the OUHSC and OMRF to present and share knowledge about using Python to do science. These meeting may also spark collaborations on papers and grant applications.
 
 
## Plan of Operation
The long-term goal is to build a community of Python users to promote the further development of skills of researchers at OUHSC and OMRF in using Python to help address scientific problems in biomedicine.
 
The format will that of an interactive workshop. Although this is not a course nor a journal club, novices are encouraged to attend, learn, and participate. The goal is keep the presentations accessible and in the style of a workshop. The advanced speakers will be asked to include material for beginners so that everyone can leave the presentations with new and useful knowledge. Likewise, although the presentation may be about a domain specific topic, its introduction should be long enough to include material of general applicability that most users can take home. Beginning users are strongly encouraged to give presentations. There no better way to learn a topic than to give a talk about it.
 
We will strive to send out the approximate title of the talk a week in advance to remind people of the upcoming meeting. Ideally, we will also distribute the slides and script files at least a day in advance of the meetings so that mailing list members can decide if the meeting is worth their time attending and so that attendees can follow along on their laptop computers. Speakers will have the option of posting their material on the GitHub site, if their material is not of a sensitive nature (e.g., HIPPA, FERPA, proprietary, copyright fair use issues).
 
The format and idea for this group was inspired by the OUHSC Statistical Computing Users Group. If i you also are interested in the statistical computing and the package R, the Statistical Computing Users Group may be of interest to you (https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/StatisticalComputing). Most of the presentations at SCUG are with the program R, but some are with Python. It meets at 9:30 AM on the first Tuesday of each month in the East Boardroom of the Samis Education Center in Children's Hospital.
 
 
## Organizers
 
Cory Giles, Frank Hays, Timothy Mather, Blaine Mooers, Dee Wu. The organizers will rotate hosting the meeting to diversify the perspective.
